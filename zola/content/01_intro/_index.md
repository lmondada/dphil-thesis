This thesis is first and foremost a story about compilers.
It is interesting to note that whereas the term *quantum compilation* has been in use for the longest part
of the existence of quantum computing as a field,
it is only recently that our community has started to adopt tools, ideas and results from our classical counterparts
{% footnote(id="test") %}
We use the word *classical* as a derogatory term to refer to any form of computing that is not advanced enough to
be quantum.
{% end %}.

Strengthening the bridge between classical and quantum compilation research is one of the main motivations for this thesis -- and arguably its most ambitious goal.
