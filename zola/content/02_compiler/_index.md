This thesis is first and foremost a story about compilers.
Whilst this chapter should by no means be taken as a review of the 70+ years of classical compilation research, 
we will introduce a selection of core ideas and results of the field, selected arbitrarily for their relevance to the rest of this thesis.

It is interesting to note that whereas the term *quantum compilation* has been in use for the longest part
of the existence of quantum computing as a field,
it is only recently that our community has started to adopt tools, ideas and results from our classical counterparts.
FOOTNOTE: we use the word *classical* as a derogatory term to refer to any form of computing that is not advanced enough to
be quantum.
Strengthening the bridge between classical and quantum compilation research is one of the main motivations for this thesis -- and arguably its most ambitious goal.
