  abstract     = {In recent years, we have witnessed an increasing use of graph pattern matching in a wide variety of applications such as social networks analysis, knowledge discovery, software plagiarism detection and many more. It is typically defined in terms of subgraph isomorphism, an NP-Complete problem. To overcome this cost, many extensions of graph simulation have been proposed that allow graph pattern matching to be conducted in cubic-time. However, in emerging applications, more expressive patterns are needed, notably ones with counting quantifiers (CQs) which are not considered by simulation-based approaches. In this article, we propose a simulation-based graph pattern matching approach that supports CQs on edges of graph patterns. We first consider CQs that express numeric aggregates only. We show that our approach is in ptime as earlier extensions of graph simulation by providing a cubic-time quantified matching algorithm, i.e., an algorithm for matching graph patterns that contain CQs. In the second part, we discuss the problem of Label-Repetition Constraints (LRCs). We define a necessary and sufficient condition for the satisfaction of LRCs. Based on this condition, we give an extension of our quantified matching algorithm to deal with LRCs in ptime, together with an optimization technique. Finally, we show that our quantified graph pattern matching approach retains the same complexity bounds when dealing with ratio aggregates. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to deal with numeric aggregates, ratio aggregates, and LRCs on graph patterns in ptime.},

  abstract   = {Subgraph isomorphism can be determined by means of a brute-force tree-search enumeration procedure. In this paper a new algorithm is introduced that attains efficiency by inferentially eliminating successor nodes in the tree search. To assess the time actually taken by the new algorithm, subgraph isomorphism, clique detection, graph isomorphism, and directed graph isomorphism experiments have been carried out with random and with various nonrandom graphs.A parallel asynchronous logic-in-memory implementation of a vital part of the algorithm is also described, although this hardware has not actually been built. The hardware implementation would allow very rapid determination of isomorphism.},

  abstract     = {Graphs are ubiquitous and ever-present data structures that have a wide range of applications involving social networks, knowledge bases and biological interactions. The evolution of a graph in such scenarios can yield important insights about the nature and activities of the underlying network, which can then be utilized for applications such as news dissemination, network monitoring, and content curation. Capturing the continuous evolution of a graph can be achieved by long-standing sub-graph queries. Although, for many applications this can only be achieved by a set of queries, state-of-the-art approaches focus on a single query scenario. In this paper, we therefore introduce the notion of continuous multi-query processing over graph streams and discuss its application to a number of use cases. To this end, we designed and developed a novel algorithmic solution for efficient multi-query evaluation against a stream of graph updates and experimentally demonstrated its applicability. Our results against two baseline approaches using real-world, as well as synthetic datasets, confirm a two orders of magnitude improvement of the proposed solution.},

TCP is an important transport-layer protocol in the Internet protocol stack, and it has continuously evolved over decades of use and growth of the Internet. Over this time, a number of changes have been made to TCP as it was specified in RFC 793, though these have only been documented in a piecemeal fashion. This document collects and brings those changes together with the protocol specification from RFC 793. This document obsoletes RFC 793, as well as RFCs 879, 2873, 6093, 6429, 6528, and 6691 that updated parts of RFC 793. It updates RFCs 1011 and 1122, and it should be considered as a replacement for the portions of those documents dealing with TCP requirements. It also updates RFC 5961 by adding a small clarification in reset handling while in the SYN-RECEIVED state. The TCP header control bits from RFC 793 have also been updated based on RFC 3168.},

We give a brief introduction to the ZX-calculus, then show how PyZX implements methods for circuit optimisation, equality validation, and visualisation and how it can be used in tandem with other software. We end with a set of challenges that when solved would expand the power of automated diagrammatic reasoning.},

The main applications of ZX calculus are in quantum computation. We train small transformers to simplify ZX graphs, i.e. perform resource optimisation of quantum circuits. Preliminary experiments show that transformers can be trained to simplify CNOT and Clifford circuits with high accuracy. These are the simplest kinds of ZX graphs, in the sense that there exists an efficient rewrite strategy. We also show evidence that transformers learn to simplify the more complex Clifford+T graphs, for which in general there does not exist an efficient simplification algorithm.},

The algorithm is efficient and the resulting circuits do not contain ancillae. One-way computations are represented using the ZX-calculus, hence the algorithm also represents the most general known procedure for extracting circuits from ZX-diagrams. In developing this algorithm, we generalise several concepts and results previously known for computations containing only XY-plane measurements. We bring together several known rewrite rules for measurement patterns and formalise them in a unified notation using the ZX-calculus. These rules are used to simplify measurement patterns by reducing the number of qubits while preserving both the semantics and the existence of gflow. The results can be applied to circuit optimisation by translating circuits to patterns and back again.},

  abstract  = {In the model of measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC), computations are performed via sequential measurements on a highly entangled graph state. MBQC is a natural model for photonic quantum computing and has been shown to be useful for tasks like optimization and verification of general quantum computations. Therefore, it is often necessary to translate between MBQC and the predominantly used quantum circuit model in a fast and reliable way. While there are algorithms with linear complexity to extract quantum circuits from measurement patterns using additional ancilla qubits, efficient ancilla-free extraction has shown to be more costly. We develop strategies to parallelize an existing extraction algorithm based on ZX-calculus by exploiting the graph structure of measurement patterns and evaluate the performance on patterns obtained from a benchmark set of quantum circuits. Our results suggest that possible parallelization speedups are closely related to the graph structure of a pattern.},

This calculus is obtained by combining the QPath calculus, a diagrammatic language for linear optics, and the recently developed qudit ZXW calculus, a complete axiomatisation of linear maps between qudits. It comes with a 'lifting' theorem allowing to prove equalities between infinite operators by rewriting in the ZXW calculus. We give a method for representing bosonic and fermionic Hamiltonians in the infinite ZW calculus. This allows us to derive their exponentials by diagrammatic reasoning. Examples include phase shifts and beam splitters, as well as non-linear Kerr media and Jaynes-Cummings light-matter interaction.},

  abstract  = {Finding the optimal pass sequence of compilation can lead to a significant reduction in program size. Prior works on compilation pass ordering have two major drawbacks. They either require an excessive budget (in terms of the number of compilation passes) at compile time or fail to generalize to unseen programs. In this work, instead of predicting passes sequentially, we directly learn a policy on the pass sequence space, which outperforms the default -Oz flag by an average of 4.5\% over a large collection (4683) of unseen code repositories from diverse domains across 14 datasets. To achieve this, we first identify a small set (termed coreset) of pass sequences that generally optimize the size of most programs. Then, a policy is learned to pick the optimal sequences by predicting the normalized values of the pass sequences in the coreset. Our results demonstrate that existing human-designed compiler passes can be improved with a simple yet effective technique that leverages pass sequence space which contains dense rewards, while approaches operating on the individual pass space may suffer from issues of sparse reward, and do not generalize well to heldout programs from different domains.

  abstract   = {An e-graph efficiently represents a congruence relation over many expressions. Although they were originally developed in the late 1970s for use in automated theorem provers, a more recent technique known as equality saturation repurposes e-graphs to implement state-of-the-art, rewrite-driven compiler optimizations and program synthesizers. However, e-graphs remain unspecialized for this newer use case. Equality saturation workloads exhibit distinct characteristics and often require ad-hoc e-graph extensions to incorporate transformations beyond purely syntactic rewrites.  This work contributes two techniques that make e-graphs fast and extensible, specializing them to equality saturation. A new amortized invariant restoration technique called rebuilding takes advantage of equality saturation's distinct workload, providing asymptotic speedups over current techniques in practice. A general mechanism called e-class analyses integrates domain-specific analyses into the e-graph, reducing the need for ad hoc manipulation.  We implemented these techniques in a new open-source library called egg. Our case studies on three previously published applications of equality saturation highlight how egg's performance and flexibility enable state-of-the-art results across diverse domains.},

Rules, represented as labelled port graphs, apply to states, also represented as labelled port graphs, and compute their successors according to the given strategy.

  abstract = {Due to the dramatic increase in computing power and the concomitant decrease in computing cost that has occurred over the last decade, many researchers are attempting to design computing systems to solve complicated problems or execute tasks that have in the past been performed by human experts. The focus of Knowledge Engineering is the construction of such complex "expert system" programs. This thesis will describe the architecture and the software systems embodying the DADO machine, a parallel tree-structured computer designed to provide significant performance improvements over serial computers of comparable hardware complexity in the execution of large expert systems implemented in production system form.The central contribution of this thesis is a new match algorithm for executing production systems, TREAT, that will be presented and comparatively analyzed with the RETE match algorithm. TREAT, originally designed specifically for the DADO machine architecture can handle efficiently both temporally redundant and nontemporally redundant production system programs. Although the development of the algorithm was motivated by the inadequacies of the parallel versions of existing production system algorithms, it is shown that the TREAT algorithm performs better than the best known sequential algorithm, the RETE match, even on a sequential machine.},

  abstract  = {When a C programmer needs an efficient data structure for a particular problem, he or she can often simply look one up in any of a number of good textbooks or handbooks. Unfortunately, programmers in functional languages such as Standard ML or Haskell do not have this luxury. Although some data structures designed for imperative languages such as C can be quite easily adapted to a functional setting, most cannot, usually because they depend in crucial ways on assignments, which are disallowed, or at least discouraged, in functional languages. To address this imbalance, we describe several techniques for designing functional data structures, and numerous original data structures based on these techniques, including multiple variations of lists, queues, double-ended queues, and heaps, many supporting more exotic features such as random access or efficient catenation. In addition, we expose the fundamental role of lazy evaluation in amortized functional data structures. Traditional methods of amortization break down when old versions of a data structure, not just the most recent, are available for further processing. This property is known as persistence, and is taken for granted in functional languages. On the surface, persistence and amortization appear to be incompatible, but we show how lazy evaluation can be used to resolve this conflict, yielding amortized data structures that are efficient even when used persistently. Turning this relationship between lazy evaluation and amortization around, the notion of amortization also provides the first practical techniques for analyzing the time requirements of non-trivial lazy programs.Finally, our data structures offer numerous hints to programming language designers, illustrating the utility of combining strict and lazy evaluation in a single language, and providing non-trivial examples using polymorphic recursion and higher-order, recursive modules.},

  abstract   = {We present a decomposition technique that uses non-deterministic circuits to approximate an arbitrary single-qubit unitary to within distance ε and requires significantly fewer non-Clifford gates than existing techniques. We develop "Repeat-Until-Success" (RUS) circuits and characterize unitaries that can be exactly represented as an RUS circuit. Our RUS circuits operate by conditioning on a given measurement outcome and using only a small number of non-Clifford gates and ancilla qubits. We construct an algorithm based on RUS circuits that approximates an arbitrary single-qubit Z-axis rotation to within distance ε, where the number of T gates scales as 1:26 log2(1/ε) - 3:53, an improvement of roughly three-fold over state-of-the-art techniques. We then extend our algorithm and show that a scaling of 2:4 log2(1/ε) - 3:28 can be achieved for arbitrary unitaries and a small range of ε, which is roughly twice as good as optimal deterministic decomposition methods.},
