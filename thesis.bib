  abstract     = {In recent years, we have witnessed an increasing use of graph pattern matching in a wide variety of applications such as social networks analysis, knowledge discovery, software plagiarism detection and many more. It is typically defined in terms of subgraph isomorphism, an NP-Complete problem. To overcome this cost, many extensions of graph simulation have been proposed that allow graph pattern matching to be conducted in cubic-time. However, in emerging applications, more expressive patterns are needed, notably ones with counting quantifiers (CQs) which are not considered by simulation-based approaches. In this article, we propose a simulation-based graph pattern matching approach that supports CQs on edges of graph patterns. We first consider CQs that express numeric aggregates only. We show that our approach is in ptime as earlier extensions of graph simulation by providing a cubic-time quantified matching algorithm, i.e., an algorithm for matching graph patterns that contain CQs. In the second part, we discuss the problem of Label-Repetition Constraints (LRCs). We define a necessary and sufficient condition for the satisfaction of LRCs. Based on this condition, we give an extension of our quantified matching algorithm to deal with LRCs in ptime, together with an optimization technique. Finally, we show that our quantified graph pattern matching approach retains the same complexity bounds when dealing with ratio aggregates. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to deal with numeric aggregates, ratio aggregates, and LRCs on graph patterns in ptime.},

  abstract   = {Subgraph isomorphism can be determined by means of a brute-force tree-search enumeration procedure. In this paper a new algorithm is introduced that attains efficiency by inferentially eliminating successor nodes in the tree search. To assess the time actually taken by the new algorithm, subgraph isomorphism, clique detection, graph isomorphism, and directed graph isomorphism experiments have been carried out with random and with various nonrandom graphs.A parallel asynchronous logic-in-memory implementation of a vital part of the algorithm is also described, although this hardware has not actually been built. The hardware implementation would allow very rapid determination of isomorphism.},

  abstract     = {Graphs are ubiquitous and ever-present data structures that have a wide range of applications involving social networks, knowledge bases and biological interactions. The evolution of a graph in such scenarios can yield important insights about the nature and activities of the underlying network, which can then be utilized for applications such as news dissemination, network monitoring, and content curation. Capturing the continuous evolution of a graph can be achieved by long-standing sub-graph queries. Although, for many applications this can only be achieved by a set of queries, state-of-the-art approaches focus on a single query scenario. In this paper, we therefore introduce the notion of continuous multi-query processing over graph streams and discuss its application to a number of use cases. To this end, we designed and developed a novel algorithmic solution for efficient multi-query evaluation against a stream of graph updates and experimentally demonstrated its applicability. Our results against two baseline approaches using real-world, as well as synthetic datasets, confirm a two orders of magnitude improvement of the proposed solution.},

  abstract = {Existing work on subgraph isomorphism search mainly focuses on a-query-at-a-time approaches: optimizing and answering each query separately. When multiple queries arrive at the same time, sequential processing is not always the most efficient. In this paper, we study multi-query optimization for subgraph isomorphism search. We first propose a novel method for efficiently detecting useful common sub-graphs and a data structure to organize them. Then we propose a heuristic algorithm based on the data structure to compute a query execution order so that cached intermediate results can be effectively utilized. To balance memory usage and the time for cached results retrieval, we present a novel structure for caching the intermediate results. We provide strategies to revise existing single-query subgraph isomorphism algorithms to seamlessly utilize the cached results, which leads to significant performance improvement. Extensive experiments verified the effectiveness of our solution.},
